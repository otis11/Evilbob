# Bob
Hello, Hello! This is Bob. A browser command palette.

Bob's results are organized into Result Groups with linked permissions. For instance, the "tabs" group helps to manage tabs and needs permission to do so. Almost all Result Groups are off by default, to start off minimal. Pick the ones you love!
