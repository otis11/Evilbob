# Bob
Hello, Hello! This is Bob. A browser command palette. 

Bob opens from anywhere in your browser using a shortcut! (Chromium allows the shortcut to be global)

Search results are organized into Search Groups with linked permissions. For instance, the "tabs" group helps manage tabs and needs permission to do so. Almost all Search Groups are off by default, to start off minimal. Pick the ones you love!
