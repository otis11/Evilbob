# Bob
Hello, Hello! This is Bob. A browser command palette. 

Bob opens in a new window and can be opened from basically anywhere in the browser using a defined shortcut! (in Chromium even from outside the browser, when setting the shortcut to global)

Bob lets you decide which Search Groups and linked permissions should be enabled/disabled.
