# Bob
Hello, Hello! This is Bob. A browser command palette.

Bob's search results are organized into Search Groups with linked permissions. For instance, the "tabs" group helps to manage tabs and needs permission to do so. Almost all Search Groups are off by default, to start off minimal. Pick the ones you love!
